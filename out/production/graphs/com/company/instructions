Assignments 4,5,6. Graph algorithms

Write classes ALGraph, GNode, GEdge, and implement the following graph algorithms using common data structures:
BFS
DFS
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Complete edge classification for directed graphs
calculation of low for directed graphs
Biconnected components, bridges, articulation points â€“ undirected graphs
max flow using augmentation algorithm from textbook

Everybody must use the same layout and same names for the three classes mentioned above and their data members (fields).
